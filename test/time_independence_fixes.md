# Time Independence Test Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure tests pass regardless of when they are executed.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. TimeHelpers Tests (`test/aprsme_web/time_helpers_test.exs`)
- Changed exact string matches to flexible pattern matching
- Example: `"1 minute ago"` → `["1 minute ago", "about 1 minute ago"]`
- Added regex patterns for variable outputs

### 2. Packets Oldest Tests (`test/aprsme/packets_oldest_test.exs`)
- Replaced hardcoded dates like `~U[2023-01-01 00:00:00Z]`
- Now uses relative dates: `DateTime.add(now, -365 * 24 * 60 * 60, :second)`
- All date calculations are now relative to current time

### 3. Broadcast Task Supervisor Tests (`test/aprsme/broadcast_task_supervisor_test.exs`)
- Increased timing assertion from 100ms to 1000ms
- Makes tests less sensitive to system load and CI environment performance

### 4. Movement Tests (`test/aprsme_web/live/map_live/movement_test.exs`)
- Increased `refute_push_event` timeout from 500ms to 2000ms
- Prevents false failures on slower systems

### 5. Packet Consumer Tests (`test/aprsme/packet_consumer_test.exs`)
- Increased Process.sleep from 20ms to 100ms for async operations
- Increased assert_receive timeout from 1000ms to 5000ms

### 6. Integration Tests (`test/integration/historical_loading_integration_test.exs`)
- Increased all Process.sleep calls: 500ms → 1000ms, 2000ms → 3000ms
- Gives Wallaby more time for browser operations

### 7. Streaming Packets PubSub Tests (`test/aprsme/streaming_packets_pubsub_test.exs`)
- Increased assert_receive timeout from 100ms to 1000ms
- Increased refute_receive timeout from 100ms to 500ms

## General Patterns Applied

1. **Relative Time Calculations**: All date/time calculations now use offsets from `DateTime.utc_now()`
2. **Flexible Assertions**: String comparisons allow for slight variations in output
3. **Generous Timeouts**: Increased timeouts to handle slower CI environments
4. **No Hardcoded Dates**: Removed all specific date literals

## Testing Strategy

These changes ensure that:
- Tests pass regardless of the current date/time
- Tests are resilient to performance variations
- Tests work reliably in CI/CD environments
- Tests don't fail due to timezone differences
