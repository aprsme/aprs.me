This is an elixir & phoenix project that uses esbuild and as much liveview as possible. Do not directly try to interact with npm. Ensure liveview is used as much as possible to minimize javascript. When writing or changing code, ensure the tests still pass and you did not break other parts of the code by running "mix test". Ensure you are writing idiomatic elixir and using as much function and pattern matching as possible instead of if/case conditionals. Keep your responses breif and do not say "you're right" or echo back what I've said. Keep the output short and sweet only telling me issues that come up or what you've done. Fix any compile warnings you create or encounter as well. Do not be emotional, be straight to the point and do not use fluff words.
