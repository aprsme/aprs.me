# Claude Session Summary - August 2, 2025

## Session Overview
This session focused on updating the APRS.me codebase to handle improved APRS parser features based on updates from the vendor/aprs library.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced APRS Parser Integration
- **Initial Request**: "the parser has been improved again with these updates, please update the code to handle them"
- **Parser Improvements Implemented**:
  - Added 11 new standard parser fields for better compatibility
  - Implemented comprehensive weather data extraction with dedicated wx field
  - Fixed PHG parsing to return string format instead of map structure
  - Added radiorange (RNG) field parsing from comments
  - Enhanced comment processing with proper data extraction and cleaning
  - Improved compressed position parsing with APRS messaging capability

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- Created migration `20250801231447_add_enhanced_parser_fields.exs`
- Added 20 new fields to packets table:
  - Standard parser fields: srccallsign, dstcallsign, body, origpacket, header, alive, posambiguity, symboltable, symbolcode, messaging
  - Radio range field: radiorange
  - Weather fields: rain_midnight, has_weather (some already existed)

### 3. Code Updates in lib/aprsme/packet.ex
- Added `put_standard_parser_fields/2` function to extract new parser compatibility fields
- Added `put_radio_range_field/2` function for radiorange extraction
- Enhanced `extract_weather_data/2` to prioritize new wx field from improved parser
- Updated `put_phg_fields/2` to handle both string format ("1060") and legacy map structure
- Added `parse_phg_string/2` for parsing 4-character PHG strings

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Created `test/aprsme/enhanced_parser_test.exs` with 6 tests
- Tests cover:
  - Standard parser field extraction
  - Radio range field extraction
  - Weather data from wx field
  - PHG data in both string and map formats
  - Full packet storage with enhanced fields
- All 467 tests passing with 0 failures

### 5. Previous Work in Session
Before the parser update task, the session included:
- Improving test coverage from 41.62% to meet 90% threshold
- Writing comprehensive test suites for Aprsme.Packets, Cluster.LeaderElection, and Cluster.ConnectionManager modules
- Fixing production issues including:
  - Buffer full errors (actually PacketConsumer crashes)
  - Telemetry_vals data type mismatches
  - Missing position_ambiguity column
- Optimizing test suite performance (48% speed improvement)
- Multiple git commits and pushes throughout

## Key Technical Details

### Parser Field Mappings
The enhanced parser now provides these additional fields that are mapped to database columns:
- `posambiguity` → position_ambiguity (0-4 level indicator)
- `wx` → dedicated weather data field (prioritized over other weather fields)
- `radiorange` → RNG field from comments (e.g., "RNG0050")
- PHG data now comes as string "1060" instead of map structure

### Backward Compatibility
All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Weather extraction checks multiple field locations (wx, weather, weather_report, raw_weather_data)
- PHG parsing handles both string and map formats
- Standard fields are extracted from top-level attributes if present

## Current State
- All code changes committed and pushed to main branch
- Database migration successfully applied
- Test suite fully passing
- Code formatted and no compilation warnings
- Ready for deployment to production

## Remaining Tasks
From the todo list:
1. Write tests for Aprsme.Is module (APRS-IS connection) - pending
2. Run final coverage report to verify improvements - pending

## Notes for Next Session
- The enhanced parser integration is complete and tested
- Consider deploying to production and monitoring for any issues with the new fields
- The Aprsme.Is module still needs test coverage
- May want to verify that the parser improvements are working correctly with live APRS data
